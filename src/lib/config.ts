                  objects: An observer (eye), an object (triangle) and a mirror. These objects will

    description: `<b>2.</b> There can potentially be an infinite number of light rays from a source
                  (sun, lamp, etc.) that are bouncing off the object and directed towards the
                  mirror. All of these rays follow the law of reflection which states that the
                  angle at which the incidence ray (lighter orange) hits the mirror must equal the
                  angle at which the reflection ray (darker orange) gets directed to the observer.
                  Here we are just focusing on one of the many possible light rays.`,

    description: `<b>3.</b> Light rays travel in a straight line so our brains are interpreting the
                  reflection ray (darker orange) that is entering the eye as originating from the
                  virtual world (image inside the mirror). Due to the law of reflection, the
                  virtual object appears to be the same distance as the real object to the mirror.
                  This is how we can predict the location of the virtual object as it will appear
                  to be on a straight line from the reflection ray.`,
